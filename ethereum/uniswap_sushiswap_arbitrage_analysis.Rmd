Using BigQuery, I compare Uniswap and Sushiswap pools for potential arbitrage opportunities.
BigQuery data is, I think, about 10 minutes late to the market, so this is definitely not a production ready analysis. But the idea is to get a snapshot at that point in time and see the size of opportunities.


SQL query for BigQuery.

```

## Results

Potential ROI is shown on the right and is a rough approximation calculated by dividing the ratio of reserves on both sides. This is inaccurate especially for small reserves, but gives an approximation for large reserves. Also this does not take into account the swap fees, ie 2 * 0.3% = 0.6%, nor the transaction fees.

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(knitr)

t = fread("/Users/henry/Downloads/results-20201008-143558.csv")
t = t[, list(uni_pair, sushi_pair, approx_roi=round(roi,3), uni_res0, uni_res1, sushi_res0, sushi_res1, token0, token1)]

# let's keep only pairs with WETH
t = t[(token0 == "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2") | (token1 == "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2")]

# estimate uni USD volume
t[token0 == "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2", USD_vol := 340 * uni_res0]
t[token1 == "0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2", USD_vol := 340 * uni_res1]

t = t[order(-USD_vol)]

# filtering out reserves too small
t = t[sushi_res0 >= 300][sushi_res1 >= 300]

kable(t, "pipe")


```

We can see that the top 5 markets are very well in sync already between Uniswap and Sushiswap.

A more thorough analysis of the ROI is necessary here to conclude if any opportunity is available on the smaller markets.
